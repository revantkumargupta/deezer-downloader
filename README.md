### Features

- download songs, albums, public playlists from Deezer.com (account is required, free plan is enough)
- download Spotify playlists (by parsing the Spotify website and download the songs from Deezer)
- download as zip file (including m3u8 playlist file)
- 320 kbit/s mp3s with ID3-Tags and album cover (UPDATE: right now only 128bkit/s mp3 works, see #66)
- download songs via yt-dlp
- KISS (keep it simple and stupid) front end
- MPD integration (use it on a Raspberry Pi!)
- simple REST api


### How to use it

There is a settings file template called `settings.ini.example`. You can specify the download directory with  `download_dir`. Pressing the download button only downloads the song/album/playlist. If you set `use_mpd=True` in the `settings.ini` the backend will connect to mpd (localhost:6600) and update the music database. Pressing the play button will download the music. If `use_mpd=True`  is set the mpd database will be updated and the song/album/playlist will be added to the playlist. In `settings.ini` `music_dir` should be the music root location of mpd. The `download_dir` must be a subdirectory of `music_dir`. 

As Deezer sometimes requires a captcha to login the auto login features was removed. Instead you have to manually insert a valid Deezer cookie to the `settings.ini`. The relevant cookie is the `arl` cookie. 



### How to use it
#### with pip
You can run `pip install --user deezer-downloader`. Then you can run `~/.local/bin/deezer-downloader --help`

#### with Docker
You can use the Docker image hosted on [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/r/kmille2/deezer-downloader). Login into your free Deezer account and grab the `arl` cookie. Then:

```bash
mkdir downloads
sudo docker run -p 5000:5000 --volume $(pwd)/downloads/:/mnt/deezer-downloader --env DEEZER_COOKIE_ARL=changeme kmille2/deezer-downloader:latest 
xdg-open http://localhost:5000
```

#### with Vagrant

```bash	
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
sudo vim /opt/deezer/settings.ini # insert your Deezer cookie
cd /opt/deezer && sudo poetry run deezer-downloader --config settings.ini

# On the host:
xdg-open http://localhost:5000 # view frontend in the browser
ncmpcpp -h 127.0.0.1 # try the mpd client
```

#### as a service

We use it with nginx and [ympd](https://github.com/notandy/ympd) as mpd frontend

- / goes to ympd
- /d/ goes to the downloader

The deployment directory contains a systemd unit file and a nginx vhost config file. There is also a [patch](https://github.com/kmille/music-ansible/blob/master/roles/ympd/files/fix_header.patch) to add a link to the ympd frontend. The `debug` tab will show you the debug output of the app.Shortcuts



If you want to debug or build it from source: there is a docker-compose file in the docker directory. The `docker/downloads` directory is mounted into the container and will be used as download directory. You have to check the permissions of the `docker/downloads` directory as docker mounts it with the same owner/group/permissions as on the host. The `deezer` user in the docker container has uid 1000. If you also have the uid 1000 then there should be no problem. For debugging: `sudo docker-compose build --force-rm && sudo docker-compose up`

#### developer setup (tested on Ubuntu Jammy)

```bash
  sudo apt-get update -q
  sudo apt-get install -qy vim tmux git ffmpeg

  # python3-poetry is too old (does not support groups ...)
  sudo apt-get install -qy python3-pip
  sudo pip install poetry
  git clone https://github.com/kmille/deezer-downloader.git
  cd deezer-downloader
  poetry install
  poetry run deezer-downloader --show-config-template > settings.ini

  # enable yt-dlp
  sudo pip install yt-dlp
  sed -i 's,.*command = /usr/bin/yt-dlp.*,command = /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp,' settings.ini

  # enable mpd
  sudo apt-get install -yq mpd ncmpcpp
  sudo sed -i 's,^music_directory.*,music_directory         "/tmp/deezer-downloader",' /etc/mpd.conf
  sudo systemctl restart mpd
  sed -i 's/.*use_mpd = False.*/use_mpd = True/' settings.ini

  # 1) Adjust the Deezer cookie: vim settings.ini
  # 2) Run tests: DEEZER_DOWNLOADER_CONFIG_FILE=settings.ini poetry run pytest -v -s
  # 3) Run it: poetry run deezer-downloader --config settings.ini
  # 4) Try out: ncmpcpp -h 127.0.0.1 && xdg-open http://localhost:5000
  # 5) Downloaded files are in /tmp/deezer-downloader

### Tests

```bash
cd deezer-downloader
DEEZER_DOWNLOADER_CONFIG_FILE=settings.ini poetry run pytest -v -s
# if you don't setDEEZER_DOWNLOADER_CONFIG_FILE the default template file will be used. Some tests will fail because there is no valid arl_cookie.
```
